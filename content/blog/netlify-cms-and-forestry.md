![Netlify CMS](/images/jamstack.jpg)

A few weeks ago, I tried <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/" target="_blank">Netlify CMS</a> and <a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank">Forestry</a>, and here are the results.

## Speed
JAM stands for javascript, API, and markup. While serving over content delivery network (CDN) with deployment, they're blazing fast. You don't have to setup database or .htaccess files anymore.

## Simplicity
Forestry is built in elegant modern style. Both of them provide an extremely simple layout which is also good for non-tech-savvy bloggers.

## Security
They are run in HTML deployed using API over CDN protected by Let's Encrpt Authority, therefore security is all time high.

## Cost
All you have to spend is buying a domain name, which by the way, you could also do for free from <a href="https://www.freenom.com/" target="_blank">FreeNom</a>. Then your files are hosted for free on Github and DNS can be either Netlify's or your own hosting provider. What's left? Emails? Use Zoho free for creating upto 25 emails using SPF and DKIM records.
