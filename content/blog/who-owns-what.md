If we look at things logically, not even a single moment or the tiniest drop belongs to us. Here is how.<br>

## Context
Our age can't be stopped, we forget things including knowledge that some feel proud of, anybody can face an accident at any moment with absolute uncertainty towards the type or magnitude of those accidents that change his whole life, and the soul is a light within us to be deported at any time and body is structure of bones, blood, and soil that is a dead perishable piece after soul departs.<br>

Your thoughts, body movements, society around you, things you can feel, touch and even those you can't understand that are above your level.<br>

## Reason
You can not claim what does not belong to you, but you can ask for it. If you have worked harder than anybody else, it only means you were given enough energy and focus, unlike others. Be thankful for that, but do not claim the rewards.<br>

And while you do not have the rights to claim, there no chance of longing for it or be depressed in its thoughts. So, logically we MUST be thankful to God equally for grief and joy, least or most, worst or best.<br>

## Finally
To make it more simple, if anything could belong to us, we could take control of it in the way or till the time we wanted to, and not nature.<br>

Every single thing is a blessing, start counting your blessings and you will wonder.
