In 2017, I posted a short clip followed by similar other video clips.

<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.2';
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class="fb-video" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/BuddysFOY/videos/624278257764227/"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/BuddysFOY/videos/624278257764227/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuddysFOY/videos/624278257764227/"></a><p>Making of Street food in Pakistan - Samosa and Vegetable Roll Covering Roti #foodinpakistan</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuddysFOY/">Buddy&#039;s</a> on Tuesday, January 3, 2017</blockquote></div>

## Thumbnail
As human pyschology can easily be attracted by the visuals, the video thumbnail was intentionally kept unique.

## Struggle
The 3:17 minutes long video is composed of humans working hard to earn their bread and butter.

## Food
Everyone has close attachment to food items, is also visible.

This video clips generated 25k organic fanbase in a period of two weeks.
