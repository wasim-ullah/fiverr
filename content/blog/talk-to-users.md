## Points
The Mom Test

<ol>
<li>Talk about their life, not your idea <li>
Talk specifics, not hypotheticals <li>
Listen, don’t talk
</ol>

Five great questions you can ask in every user interview:

<ol>
<li>What’s the hardest part about [doing this thing]? <li>
Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem <li>
Why was that hard? <li>
What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem? <li>
What don’t you love about the solutions you’ve tried?
</ol>
