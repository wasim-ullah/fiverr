I recently came across these three amazing minimal website designs:

## First

<a href="http://vermoortel.com/">Pieternel Vermoortel</a> is a website of an artistic director.

## Second

<a href="http://rosemarybutcher.com/">Rosemary Butcher</a> is a dance and visual artist.

## Third

<a href="https://year0001.com/">YL</a> is an in-house creative studio.
