If you have not seen people debating no matter what is the rule of thumb, national law, laws of nature, needs of humanity, or God's ruling, you should go back and do it before reading this piece any further.<br>
## Buyers
From sales men to advertisers, everyone would tell you things in their perspectives and convey those ideas to your ears. Repeating an ad on televion, newspaper, social media, search engines, and keep brand's values consistent is important so that everyone watching that information memorize it and have a thinking about it. Yet, some people will like and others don't. A salesman would want you to believe him before he ends his meeting.<br>
## Society
From politicians to social workers to religious leaders, all convey information based on and for the interests of their group of audience. Just like advertisers, their success depends on getting their audience trust in them, too.<br>
## Check
The universal fact is that except for religious revelation without human input of any form, be it a translation into another language or explanation of the message, nothing is perfect and sound to its limitlessness.
## Finally
The conclusion, with its limitations, is that there could be a countless number of ways for humans to see things, both tangible and intangible.
