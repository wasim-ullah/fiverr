![An Ideal Growth Team](/images/growth.jpg)


The most important person on the growth team is the growth master, head of growth. Over the time, you will need other people on the team.

## First
Intially, you are recommended to start with shared resouces, therefore, you don't have to spend the next six months to build the ideal growth team. Start by just borrowing resources to get your testing going, to run your growth meeting, and to hit your testing tempo. So you maybe borrowing design and engineering resources, as well as additional marketing people, analytsts, whatever you need in that growth team to actually hit your testing tempo.

## Second
Over the time you might find what's slowing you down is that you have to fight for a design, that the designer is never available when you need them, that's a really good that you should go out and add a full time dedicated designer to your team. And same thing is with engineering, marketing, analytsts. Whatever you have the bottle-next that is slowing down your testing tempo, that's a good opportunity to add dedicated people into that roles.

## Third
A lot of times you maybe tempted to hire a specialist around a channel, say Facebook or Pinterest or Instagram, or general even, say marketing, but you might found that you don't necessarily know if that channel is going to work for you. So it is recommended that pay double in the beginning if you need to a contract specialist to test that channel and then if you find that the channel is wokring. Then, you can start to think about the long term solution, whether or not to hire a full time team member. It would make sense if the channel is proven, but you would move a lot faster if you work with temporary specialists to explore channels and then hire once it is proven.
