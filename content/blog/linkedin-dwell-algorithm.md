Dwell means "live in or at a specified place".

According to a recent <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/understanding-feed-dwell-time" target="_blank">article</a> published by LinkedIn, "At a high level, each update viewed on the feed generates two types of dwell time. First, there is dwell time “on the feed,” which starts measuring when at least half of a feed update is visible as a member scrolls through their feed. Second, there is dwell time “after the click,” which is the time spent on content after clicking on an update in the feed."

Dwell time has the following advantages over solely looking at click and viral actions:

| Click/Viral Actions | Dwell Time |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Not always measurable   | Always measurable |
| Binary indicator of engagement   | Real-valued measure of engagement |
| Noisy indicator of engagement   | Can be a more reliable indicator of engagement |
| Positive signals are rather sparse   | No shortage of signals |

For marketers, that means you have to craft LinkedIn posts that not only capture peoples’ attention, but hold it for an extended period of time.
