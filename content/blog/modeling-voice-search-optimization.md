Just like any other medium, voice search is already growing in numbers. It's now being used by 52% of people in their living rooms, 25% keep them in their bedrooms, while 22% in their kitchens, per <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/voice-assistance-consumer-experience/">Google</a>.<br>

## Opportunity
You now have the opportunity to start optimizing your content according to your listeners' favorite tools to explore the matter. Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Amazon's Alexa â€“ use Bing for their searches.<br>

## Backbone
Google voice search will bring down results according to Hummingbird's intent first method, which focuses on contextual meaning of search. People are obviously asking in the form of a sentence and not typing three to five words long phrases, when they're using these tools.<br>

## Areas
Semantic search importance, a mobile-first site, local businesses directories, need of long-tail keyword terms, the focus on precision and accuracy, not succinctness are highlights for your content calendar.
