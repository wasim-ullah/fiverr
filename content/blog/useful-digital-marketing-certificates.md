![Useful Digital Marketing Certifications](/images/dmc.png)



In the last four years, I have explored several paid and free options to learn digital marketing online. Although, I have never tried offline paid bootcamps or events, I am positive that the online courses are sufficient to understand digital marketing in your flexible hours.

## Digital Marketing Circuit
Taught by industry professionals, this course has been hosted by General Assembly, which provides professional support along the way. The course walks you through sales funnel, which I discovered much later in my career, and is assisted by assignments at the end of each module. It's a good course for middle career professionals, who do not need to start from the beginning but they have some hands on experience in the field which they will use during assignments. <br> Although, there are mentors who will be available to take weekly online sessions with you.

## Growth Master Training
Sean Ellis started the term growth hacking, who else is a better fit to tell you the exact methods to hack growth for your business? He has recorded these lectures in the growth masters training, where he talks about acquisition, activation, and retention. These are the key stages in a sales cycle of any business, which can be further divided into other steps.<br>

I have taken some other unpaid courses too, such as digital marketing specialization from Coursera, and paid ones including digital strategy by Cambridge Marketing College and from 0 to 1 million users by Ali Mese. These ones were more theoretical or just a by product of what I had already learnt by applying a common understanding of social media best practices known already.
